Zomato Restaurant Dataset Analysis
Objective:
This project analyzes the Zomato restaurant dataset, focusing on various factors such as restaurant
ratings,
cost, and services. It aims to build a machine learning model to predict restaurant ratings based on
features such as
location, cuisine, type of service, and other relevant attributes.
Libraries Used:
1. NumPy: General-purpose array-processing.
2. Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
3. Matplotlib: Plotting library for creating visualizations.
4. Seaborn: Data visualization library based on Matplotlib.
5. Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for training models.
6. ExtraTreesRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, LinearRegression, DecisionTreeRegressor: For
building and evaluating regression models.
Data Preprocessing:
1. Loading Data: The dataset is read in chunks to efficiently handle large files.
2. Handling Missing Data: Rows with missing values are dropped, and unnecessary columns like
'url', 'dish_liked', and 'phone' are removed.
3. Data Cleaning:
- Column names are adjusted for consistency (e.g., renaming 'approx_cost(for two people)' to
'cost').
- Removing unnecessary characters such as '/5' from rating values.
- Converting the 'cost' column to numeric format.
- Encoding categorical variables using factorization.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
1. Data Distribution: Various visualizations were used to explore the distribution of restaurant
attributes,
such as whether restaurants offer online orders, table booking, and the types of services provided.
2. Correlation Heatmap: A heatmap was generated to check for correlations between different
numeric variables,
aiding in the selection of relevant features for modeling.
3. Categorical Visualizations:
- Bar plots and stacked bar charts were used to visualize the relationship between restaurant
ratings and different
categorical variables like restaurant type, location, and services offered.
Machine Learning Model:
- Linear Regression: The model was trained to predict ratings based on features such as cost, type,
location, and more.
- Decision Tree Regressor: Applied to predict restaurant ratings based on the input features.
- Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble learning method used for improved accuracy.
- Extra Trees Regressor: Another ensemble method used for comparison.
Model Evaluation:
- R-Squared Score: Used to evaluate the performance of the models. The models' predictions were
compared based on the
R-squared score, which indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is
predictable from the
independent variables.
Key Insights:
1. Restaurant Ratings: The ratings of restaurants vary based on the location and the type of
services provided.
2. Cost Distribution: A count plot of restaurant costs helps understand the pricing range across
different locations and types of services.
3. Online Orders and Table Booking: Bar plots were created to understand the frequency of
restaurants offering online ordering
and table booking services.
Conclusion:
The project successfully cleansed and processed the dataset, performed exploratory analysis, and
built multiple regression models
to predict restaurant ratings. The models were evaluated using R-squared scores, and insights into
the relationship between
various restaurant features and ratings were drawn. This analysis can aid in decision-making for
restaurant owners, investors,
or anyone interested in understanding the factors affecting restaurant success.
